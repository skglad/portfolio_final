  <h1>Travel Tips for Getting To and Around Madrid</h1>
    <p>As many of our guests don't speak Spanish, we wanted to put together a small guide to help make traveling around town as easy as possible. If you need any help book accomodations or transit, please reach out to Sara or Miguel at gladchunruiz@gmail.com and we will help!</p>
</div>
<div class = "airport text-block">
    <h2>Airports</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Madrid Barajas</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The best airport to fly into for the wedding will be the Madrid Barajas airport. It is near the city center and close to the venue. Cabs from the airport to the city center are 30€ and the ride is about 30 minutes. The cab can drop you off directly at your hotel. You can also brave taking public transit which will cost about 5€ depending where you are staying.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Barcelona</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Barcelona is a great airport to fly into from the US or from any other European city, and it might be less expensive in some cases. Barcelona is about 2 hours from Madrid on the high speed train so this is an easy options as well.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>London, Paris, Amsterdam</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are traveling around Europe before or after the wedding, these three airports usually have great flights and fares from Detroit and most other US destinations. I would recommend looking at prices to compare, especially if you will be in various parts of Europe on your trip to Madrid.</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class = "accomos text-block">
    <h2>Accomodations</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>NH Hotel Colon</li>
      <ul>
        <li>We will be booking a block of rooms at this hotel. It's very comfortable and in a great location! The shuttle to the wedding will be picking up at a nearby roundabout. Also, the hotel has great accomodations for English speakers.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>AirBnB</li>
      <ul>
        <li>AirBnB is a great option in Madrid especially if you are booking for a larger grouper. The neighborhoods we recommend are: Justicia, Malasaña, and Chueca as these will be closest to the shuttle pick up/drop off area, and they are really fun neighborhoods!</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class = "transpo text-block">
    <h2>Transportation</h2>
    <p>Renting a car is not necessary if you are staying in Madrid, and I would advise not planning to use a car around the city. If you are planning to explore Spain before or after the wedding, having a car would be a great idea to see different parts of Spain. We can offere advice on places to visit and the best way to get there. If you're interested in more information about travling within Spain email Miguel and Sara at gladchunruiz@gmail.com. Also please note: most car rentals in Spain are manual, and there might be an additional cost for an automatic car.</p>
